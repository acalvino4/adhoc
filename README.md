# adhoc
A practice Bootstrap 4 website.

I built this webpage as specified by *adhoc+design+spec.png* with Bootstrap.

View at https://acalvino4.github.io/adhoc.

### Possible future modifications

* Add the HTML pages in the navbar and link to them.
* Add more Bootstrap components.
* Apply extra styling to the components.
* Make the columns even more responsive by including more breakpoints.
* Redesign the website to follow a different layout.
